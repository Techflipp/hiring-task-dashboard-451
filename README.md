# TechFlipp Frontend Task

## Overview

ðŸ‘‹ This is a NextJS interview challenge. Please fork this repo, and push your code to a branch in your forked repo (following the instructions below).

You are tasked with building a responsive frontend application that interfaces with our Camera Management API. The application will allow users to manage cameras and view demographic analytics data collected by these cameras.

### âœ… Submission Instructions

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Complete the task in a branch of your **own fork**.

3. Once you're done, follow this submission process:

   * Open an **issue** in this main repository.
   * Request for a new branch to be created with the name format:

     ```
     Request: {your-name}-submission
     ```
   * Example: `alex-submission`
   * Our team will create that branch and set up **CI/CD previews**.
   * You will then open a **pull request** from your forked repo to the new branch created under this repository.

4. Your pull request should include:

   * Setup instructions to run the app
   * Overview of your implementation
   * Any assumptions or design decisions you made
   * Screenshots or a video preview of the UI in action

ðŸš¨ Please note:
**Candidates who do not complete the task within the given timeframe will not be considered for the position.**
