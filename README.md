## üé® Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **App Router**: Utilized Next.js 13+ App Router for better performance and modern React features
- **Server Components**: Leveraged React Server Components for better initial load performance

### UI/UX
- **Component Library**: Implemented Shadcn/ui for consistent and accessible UI components
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on all device sizes
- **Dark Mode**: Added theme support with next-themes
- **Loading States**: Implemented skeleton loading states for better perceived performance

### Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting with Next.js
- **Image Optimization**: Used Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented dynamic imports for non-critical components
