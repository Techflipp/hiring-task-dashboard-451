Charts: Used recharts to display demographics analytics clearly.

Responsiveness: Optimized layout to work well on both desktop and mobile.

Routing: Each camera has dedicated routes for details, edit, and configure.

Validation: All numeric fields follow backend min/max rules via Zod schema.

Testing: Jest-based unit tests cover key reusable components like CameraCard.
