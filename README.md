# TechFlipp Frontend Task â€” Camera Management Dashboard

A camera management dashboard built with Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS v4, React Query, Axios, React Hook Form, Zod, and ShadCN UI components.

## ðŸ“¦ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MhassanAv/hiring-task-dashboard-451.git
cd hiring-task-dashboard-451
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Run development server**

```bash
yarn dev
```

4. **Open your browser**

Navigate to <http://localhost:3000>

5. **API Base URL**

Uses a public API: <https://task-451-api.ryd.wafaicloud.com>

## ðŸš€ Overview of Implementation

- Uses the Next.js 15 App Router with the app/ directory for routing and layouts.

- SSR pages to handle the cameras pages and revalidate on mutation with server actions

- Search input and size input for filtering cameras.

- Cameras page fetches and displays paginated camera data.

- Camera details and edit forms implemented using React Query's prefetching.

- Implementing React Query logic in server components with hydration boundaries and serve non empty SSR pages

- Forms use React Hook Form with Zod for validation and schema-based type safety.

- Modern Animations using framer-motion to improve the UX.

- Light and Dark modes with system preference detection using Next-Themes.

- Smooth Scrolling functionality using Lenis.

- Tag selection supports multi-select with toggling logic and synchronizes with form state.

- Controlled components used for sliders (ShadCN UI) integrated with form.

- Error and success feedback handled via Sonner toast notifications.

- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling with conditional classes based on data state.

- Skeleton loaders and loading indicators to improve UX during async data fetches.

- Pagination and search are controlled via URL query parameters for easy sharing and navigation.

- No global state library used; React Query handles all server state and caching.

## ðŸ’¡ Assumptions and Design Decisions

- the UI is fully responsive as modern dashboard should be.

- As a Dashboard, I developed it to be a hybrid app,The client side is managed by React Query to handle form submissions and optimistic updates after mutations, In addition to SSR to leveraged the power of server side rendering,ISR can be used to generate the pages and revalidate on demand.
